Mount, Format, and Test LTFS tapes on Windows with [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev).

> [!WARNING]
> It is highly recommended to Copy files instead of Moving files or risk losing your data. While every
> reasonable measure has been taken to prevent data loss, it can still occur in rare cases or with aging
> hardware. Tape drives have an internal memory buffer that stores written data before flushing it to the
> tape. When Moving files to the mount point WinLtfs creates, it gets written to this memory buffer that we
> cannot control. Once moved to the memory buffer, Windows marks the original file for deletion. If the
> Tape drive has an unexpected or intermittent error or failure while its still in the internal memory
> buffer, you may lose your data. Copying instead of moving prevents this issue as you will retain the
> original file on your computer. Only once you unmount the tape should you delete any original files.

## Supported Tape Drives

| Brand    | LTO-5 | LTO-6 | LTO-7 | LTO-8 | LTO-9 |
| -------- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| HP / HPE |  ✅   |  ✅   |  ✅   |  ✅   |  ✅   |
| Quantum  |  ✅   |  ✅   |  ✅   |  ✅   |  ✅   |
| Tandberg |  ✅   |  ✅   |  ❓   |  ❓   |  ❓   |
| IBM      |  ❌   |  ❌   |  ❌   |  ❌   |  ❌   |

- ✅: Supported, either whitelisted or has been tested.
- ❓: Uncertain as it needs to be tested to be sure.
- ❌: Not supported as it uses a different tape backend.

Support is matched on the tape drive's SCSI INQUIRY product ID, so any LTO Tape Drive that
reports one of the recognized names should work regardless of brand. The recognized forms are
HP/HPE's `Ultrium N-SCSI`, Quantum's `ULTRIUM N`, and Tandberg's `LTO-N HH` (where `N` is the
LTO generation). You can view your tape drive's reported product ID in Device Manager (its
Properties → Details → *Hardware Ids*) or with any SCSI inquiry tool.

If your LTO Tape Drive is missing from the table, listed incorrectly, or you have tested one
of the uncertain entries, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rlaphoenix/winltfs/issues)
so the list can be updated.

## Background

WinLtfs is a patch of [HPE StoreOpen's LGPL-licensed source code](https://github.com/rlaphoenix/winltfs/blob/hpe/COPYING.LIB), swapping out broken features and code for working modern replacements.

Starting August 2025 and coming into full effect on June 2026, a critical component of the original codebase no longer works on any consumer version of Windows 10 or Windows 11. This is because Microsoft now blocks older drivers that were signed in ways that are no longer trusted ([Source](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/advancing-windows-driver-security-removing-trust-for-the-cross-signed-driver-pro/4504818)). The codebase interfaced with UMFSDK.sys, the driver responsible for mounting the LTO Tape Drive. UMFSDK.sys otherwise known as FUSE4Win is very old and seemingly long abandoned, with very little information online.

On July 31, 2026, HPE officially discontinued the HPE StoreOpen Software and removed every single form of download, across all platforms. It would seem they saw it was fully broken (and had been unstable for a very long time), and decided not to continue development, try to fix it or port it to another FUSE-based SDK.

With the help of [Claude](https://claude.ai), the [latest surviving copy of HPE's StoreOpen Source Code](https://github.com/leavelet/ltfs-hp) (v3.5.0) was ported from UMFSDK (FUSE4Win) to [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev), a native Windows FUSE SDK with very similar capabilities and almost the exact same underlying FUSE2 API. This SDK has a [WHQL-certified driver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/whql-release-signature), with full Windows 10/11 and Windows Server support, even after Microsoft's driver trust changes.

Thus this project was born, allowing you to continue the use of your LTO Tape Drives on Windows. For most people this project can be considered a drop-in replacement for the entire HPE StoreOpen Suite of LTFS-related Software.

> [!NOTE]
> The last released version of HPE StoreOpen was v3.6.0, but its source code has been lost
> — no download, mirror, or archive has been found — so it is unknown what changes were made
> in it.

## Comparison to HPE StoreOpen

HPE's LTT (Library & Tape Tools) is still recommended. The following features from HPE StoreOpen are not yet implemented:

- 'Offline' mode for mounted files to disable thumbnails for better performance
  (as WinFsp does not seem to support it)
- Possibly missing obscure features I don't know about that are not advertised
  in the HPE StoreOpen GUIs...

And finally, mounting works slightly differently in this project. You must have a
valid tape cartridge inserted with LTFS format to be able to mount. In HPE's software
it lets you mount more-so the 'tape drive' instead of the tape cartridge, so you could
eject, re-insert, or change cartridge all without having to unmount/remount the tape
drive. Unfortunately, this is not seemingly possible with WinFsp, at least I can't
figure out a clean reliable way to.

## Usage

WinLtfs ships four command-line tools. Each accepts `-h`/`--help` (and `-p`/`--advanced-help`
where noted) to print the option reference reproduced below. On Windows you pass a drive letter as the `ltfs`
mountpoint and point `-i`/`config_file` at your `ltfs.conf`.

Every mount and unmount automatically backs up the tape cartridge's index partition as an XML
file to `C:\tmp\ltfs\<barcode-or-uuid>.schema`. It is highly recommended to keep these and back
them up regularly in case of tape failure. These files will be crucial in case of any data
recovery attempts. They are also very handy to go back and figure out what files each tape
cartridge holds.

### `ltfs.exe`

  -x, --fulltrace     display debug information (verbose)
```

## Reading tape attributes

A mounted tape exposes read-only information about the volume, the cartridge and
its files. Nothing here writes to the tape. Queries don't move it, except that the
first query after a tape change triggers the usual re-read of the index. Values are
read live, so a swapped tape is never reported with the old tape's values.
Attribute IDs are fixed and never reused; the full list lives in
[`attr_ioctl.h`](ltfs/src/libltfs/attr_ioctl.h).

### Method 1 (Extended attributes)

The volume root lists these as extended attributes (EAs). EA caching is off, so
they always reflect the tape currently loaded. `fsutil file queryEA` can't list them
because WinFsp reports every file's EA size as `0`; read them with `NtQueryEaFile`
instead, for example in C/C++ for a tape mounted on `T:`:

```c
/* Open the volume root; BACKUP_SEMANTICS is required to open a directory */
HANDLE root = CreateFileW(L"T:\\", FILE_READ_EA,
    FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE | FILE_SHARE_DELETE, NULL,
    OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS, NULL);

/* Read all EAs at once (NtQueryEaFile is exported by ntdll.dll) */
static ULONG buf[65536 / sizeof(ULONG)];   /* entries are 4-byte aligned */
IO_STATUS_BLOCK io;
NtQueryEaFile(root, &io, buf, sizeof(buf), FALSE, NULL, 0, NULL, TRUE);
CloseHandle(root);

/* Walk the FILE_FULL_EA_INFORMATION entries; each value follows its name and a NUL */
for (FILE_FULL_EA_INFORMATION *ea = (FILE_FULL_EA_INFORMATION *)buf; ;
     ea = (FILE_FULL_EA_INFORMATION *)((char *)ea + ea->NextEntryOffset)) {
    printf("%.*s = %.*s\n", ea->EaNameLength, ea->EaName,
        ea->EaValueLength, ea->EaName + ea->EaNameLength + 1);
    if (ea->NextEntryOffset == 0)
        break;
}
```

They can also be read one at a time with [DeviceIoControl](#method-2-deviceiocontrol) using
the IDs below.

| ID | Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x800` | `ltfs.volumeSerial` | Cartridge serial (volser) |

**Example in C/C++ (reading Volume Serial)**

```c
#include <windows.h>

HANDLE h = CreateFileW(L"T:\\", FILE_READ_EA,
    FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE | FILE_SHARE_DELETE, NULL,
    OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS, NULL);
unsigned char reply[4096];
DWORD got;
/* control code = (0xC657 << 16) | (ID << 2); no input, 4096-byte output */
DeviceIoControl(h, (0xC657u << 16) | (0x800u << 2), NULL, 0,
    reply, sizeof(reply), &got, NULL);
CloseHandle(h);
/* status at reply+8, length at reply+12, serial text at reply+64 */
```

#### Reply format

| Offset | Type | Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | uint32 | Magic `0x4C6E6957` (bytes "WinL") |
| 4 | uint32 | Reply version: `1` |
| 8 | int32 | Status: `0` on success, otherwise a negative LTFS error (see [Status codes](#status-codes)) |
| 12 | uint32 | Value length in bytes |
| 16 | char[40] | UUID of the volume that answered |
| 56 | 8 bytes | Reserved |
| 64 | char[4032] | The value as UTF-8 text (not NUL-terminated; use the length) |

All integers are little-endian. A non-zero status means the value could not be read; don't treat it as `0`.
When reading several attributes, check that every reply carries the same volume
UUID. If it changed, the tape was swapped and you should start again.

#### Status codes

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success |
| `-1040` | Attribute not present (on this tape, partition or path) |
| `-1022` | Offset is past the end of the result |
| `-1036` | The drive returned a malformed response |
| `-1037` | Not supported by this drive (e.g. DAT) |

If the request itself is invalid, or the tape changed while it was being answered,
`DeviceIoControl` fails instead and no reply is written.

### Reading raw MAM

Command `0x83b` reads cartridge memory directly in two steps: list the attribute
IDs present, then read each one. Use control code `(0xC657 << 16) | (0x83B << 2)`
with **4096-byte input and output buffers**. Zero the input buffer, then fill in:

| Offset | Type | Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | uint32 | Version: `1` |
| 4 | uint8 | Operation: `0` = read one attribute, `1` = list IDs |
| 5 | uint8 | Physical partition: `0` or `1` |
| 6 | uint16 | Attribute ID to read (`0` when listing) |
| 8 | uint32 | Byte offset to start from (`0` for the first page) |
| 12 | uint32 | Reserved: `0` |

The reply uses the reply format above with version `2`, and its reserved bytes carry
paging information:

| Offset | Type | Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 56 | uint32 | Total result size in bytes |
| 60 | uint32 | Offset this page starts at |

A result can be larger than one 4032-byte page. Repeat the request, adding the
returned length to the offset, until you have the total.

- **List result:** a sequence of 2-byte big-endian attribute IDs.
- **Read result:** the attribute exactly as the drive stores it:

| Bytes | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0–1 | Attribute ID (big-endian) |
| 2 | Bit 7 set = read-only; bits 0–1 = format (`0` binary, `1` ASCII, `2` text) |
| 3–4 | Value length (big-endian) |
| 5 onward | The value |

The engine and every tape backend DLL must come from the same build, because
raw MAM support adds a function to the backend interface.

## Testing

You can test the ltfs executables without a real tape drive using the file-based backend, a virtualized tape drive that stores its data as files.

```powershell
mkdir faketape  # create folder
.\mkltfs.exe -i .\ltfs.conf -e file -d C:/path/to/faketape -s TEST01 -n DEMO  # make a 'fake' tape drive inside
.\ltfs.exe T: -f -o config_file=C:/path/to/dist/ltfs.conf `  # mount it
    -o tape_backend=file -o devname=C:/path/to/faketape -o sync_type=close
```

## Development

### Pre-requisites

1. **MSYS2**: <https://www.msys2.org>.
2. **WinFsp** with the **Developer** feature: <https://winfsp.dev>.

### Building

From the repo root in a MINGW64 shell:

```sh
./setup.sh    # one-time: deps, WinFsp staging, autoreconf + configure
./build.sh    # compile everything and stage dist/
```

`setup.sh` is only needed once (and again after a `git clean` or a pull that
touches the autotools inputs). `build.sh` can be re-run freely, and takes an
optional target:

| Command                        | What it does                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `./build.sh`           | `make` + filedebug backend + stage `dist/` |
| `./build.sh make`      | just compile the LTFS tree                 |
| `./build.sh filedebug` | just the file-emulator tape backend        |
| `./build.sh dist`      | just (re)stage `dist/` from what is built  |
| `./build.sh clean`     | `make clean`                               |

### Output

`dist/` is a self-contained binary set:

```

## Credit

This project stands almost entirely on other people's work:

- **IBM** - the original Linear Tape File System Single Drive Edition;
  `libltfs` and the core utilities are IBM Almaden Research code.
- **Hewlett-Packard / HPE** - the Windows port (StoreOpen 3.5.0) and the
  `ltotape` drive backend for HP LTO drives.
- **OSR Open Systems Resources, Inc.** - the original Windows FUSE
  integration work inside the HP tree.
- **nix-community** - for preserving the HPE StoreOpen 3.4.2 source code
  ([nix-community/hpe-ltfs](https://github.com/nix-community/hpe-ltfs)).
- **leavelet** - for preserving the HPE StoreOpen 3.5.0 source code
  ([leavelet/ltfs-hp](https://github.com/leavelet/ltfs-hp)).
- **Bill Zissimopoulos** - [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev), whose excellent
  FUSE-compatible layer and properly signed driver make this whole approach
  possible.
- **Claude** - Assistance with porting and orchestration.

## Licensing

WinLtfs as a whole is distributed under the **GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1**
(see [LICENSE](LICENSE)) — the same license as the upstream LTFS source it patches, so the
result stays upstreamable.

The per-component license texts for everything bundled into a `dist/` build live in the
[`licenses/`](licenses/) folder (set up a little differently to HPE's original layout).
`scripts/build.sh` copies them alongside the binaries. In summary:

- The LTFS source and utilities (`libltfs`, `ltfs`, `mkltfs`, `ltfsck`, `unltfs`) are
  **LGPL-2.1**, © IBM, HP/HPE, and OSR. The WinFsp port patches modify that code and are
  therefore offered under **LGPL-2.1** as well, so they remain upstreamable.
- **WinFsp** is GPLv3 with a FLOSS exception, © Bill Zissimopoulos. Its redistributable
  `winfsp-x64.dll` is shipped in `dist/`; the FLOSS exception is what lets the LGPL-2.1 LTFS
  binaries link the WinFsp FUSE layer. Source: <https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp> (tag `v2.1`).
- The MSYS2-built runtime DLLs bundled in `dist/` carry their own licenses: libxml2 (MIT),
  ICU (Unicode), GNU libiconv (LGPL-2.1), zlib (Zlib), MinGW-w64 winpthreads (MIT/BSD), and
  the GCC runtime `libgcc`/`libstdc++` (GPL-3.0 with the GCC Runtime Library Exception).
